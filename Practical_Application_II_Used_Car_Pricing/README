# Practical Application II: What Drives the Price of a Car?

This project applies the **CRISP-DM framework** to analyze a Kaggle dataset of over 400,000 used vehicle listings.  
The goal was to identify which factors most influence car prices and to build predictive regression models to assist a used car dealership with pricing and inventory strategy.

## 📊 Project Overview
Using data science best practices, this analysis explores how attributes such as year, condition, mileage, manufacturer, and fuel type affect vehicle price.  
The process includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling with multiple regression techniques.

## 🧠 CRISP-DM Steps

1. **Business Understanding** – Define the dealership’s goal: find the main drivers of used car prices.  
2. **Data Understanding** – Explore key variables and check data quality.  
3. **Data Preparation** – Handle missing values, create derived variables like `car_age`, and encode categories.  
4. **Modeling** – Compare **Linear Regression**, **Ridge Regression**, and **Random Forest** models.  
5. **Evaluation** – Random Forest achieved the best performance with the lowest RMSE and highest R² score.  
6. **Deployment** – Recommend inventory focus on newer, low-mileage cars in excellent condition.

## 🚗 Key Findings

- **Car age** and **mileage** are the strongest negative predictors of price.  
- **Condition**, **manufacturer**, and **fuel type** have strong positive effects.  
- The **Random Forest Regressor** captured nonlinear pricing patterns and outperformed the linear models.

**Business Recommendation:**  
Use the Random Forest model to set optimal price ranges and guide acquisition decisions. Retrain the model periodically as market data evolves.

**Note:**  
The full dataset file `vehicles.csv` is too large to upload to GitHub (≈40 MB).  
It is included in the course materials and can also be downloaded directly from Kaggle:

If you are re-running this notebook, simply place `vehicles.csv` in the same directory as the notebook  
or use a small sample subset for testing.
