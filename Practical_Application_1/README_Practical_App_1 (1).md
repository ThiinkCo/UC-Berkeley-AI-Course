# Practical Application 1 — Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

This project explores customer behavior for in-vehicle coupon offers using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization in Python.

## Methods
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Analyses: Descriptive stats, grouped comparisons, bar plots, heatmaps
- Dataset: Synthetic dataset generated using the same schema as the UCI “In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation” survey

## Findings
- Highest acceptance: Coffee House & Takeaway coupons
- Drivers with partners or friends are more likely to accept
- Afternoon and sunny conditions correlate with higher acceptance

## Next Steps
- Extend analysis with logistic regression or decision trees
- Segment campaigns by passenger type and time of day
- Test stronger incentives for low-performing coupon types
